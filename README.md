1. JavaScript Array Overview - A JavaScript array is a list-like object. You can use arrays to store any kind of data in a sequence, like a list.
2. `for` vs forEach() - It's important to able to look through an array to see what it holds. This video covers two ways of doing this: the for loop, and the forEach method. We'll compare and contrast the two techniques.
3. Remove Array Items with filter() - The filter method can be used to remove elements from an array.
4. Transform Array Items with map() - Use the map method to transform elements in an array.
5. Return a Single Value from an Array with reduce() - Use the reduce method to return a single value from an array of values.
6. Chaining Array Methods - Because the map method returns an array, you can call another array method directly after it. The same is true for the filter method. This is commonly called chaining methods, because each call is like a link in a chain.
7. Combining filter() and map() - You can combine filter() and map() to clean an array of unwanted values before transforming the leftover items.
8. Combining filter() and reduce() - Combining filter() with reduce(), you can remove values from an array, using the results to compute some value.
9. Nested Data and Additional Exploration -we use the spread operator to combine arrays.
